## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

This is a screenshot of the final design, showcasing the responsive layout for desktop and mobile views. I used Chrome's Developer Tools to simulate mobile devices and verify the responsiveness of the grid.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries for responsiveness


### What I learned

This challenge helped me solidify my understanding of CSS Grid and how to structure content in a grid format. 

Code snippets:
Here is an example of how I structured the grid:

```.testimonial-grid {
  display: grid;
  gap: 1.5rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  max-width: 80%;
  margin: 2rem auto;
}
```


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to explore:

- Using CSS Grid for more complex layouts
- Improving accessibility by focusing on ARIA roles and semantic HTML
- Optimizing responsive designs for tablet screens, as it's often overlooked compared to mobile and desktop
